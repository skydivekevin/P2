To use this awesome software, you simply enter your name into the top text input field and the proprietary software will 
return which star wars character you identify with most.

If you end up in a heated debate about certain statistics related to a particular star wars character, simply search in 
the second textbox to look up all relevant data on that character. For instance, if you want to find out how tall R2d2 is, 
you can typ in R2 or R2d2 or r2-d2 and the data fields will populate with all necessary information to settle any disputes.

If you are looking up a character, and something happens to your computer or to your internet connection, feel free to refresh.
On refresh, you'll find that the character you were last looking at will appear back on the page, so you can continue
any star wars related arguments.
